Release notes & upgrade information
###################################

Some versions of |project| present more complex upgrade paths than others, and some **require** you
to take action. It is strongly recommended to read the changelog notes carefully when upgrading.
More extensive releases have their own release page linked from the changelog.

It goes without saying that you should **backup your database** before embarking on any process that
makes changes to your database.
