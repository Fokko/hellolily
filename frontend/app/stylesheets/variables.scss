# Variables #

To secure consistency throughout the application we have set a couple of styling
variables. By changing these variables the general look and feel of the application
can be adjusted.

### Variable naming convention ###
Variables should be named in a manner that the values can easily be changed. To
give an example a variable like `$red: #dfba49;` is not a well named variable.
It can never contain a blue value. Instead a variable name like
`$criticalPrioColor: #dfba49;` is prefered. This variable name creates meaning to it.
