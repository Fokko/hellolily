metronic_version:3.6.3


To upgrade:
- Look at upgrade notes in the metronic template
- We only use layout 4 so you only need to overwrite those files in:
    - assets/admin/layout4/
    - sass/admin/layout4/
    - templates/admin4/
- We have a few customizations which couldn't be done in custom files, check if these should be reapplied:
    * in layout.js: function initSidebar: line 439 and 447: commented out the function of handleFixedSidebar
        ? This functions hides the blue 'active menu item' lines
        ? It stretches the menu across the entire page (which we don't want)
