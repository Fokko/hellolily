metronic_version:3.6.3


To upgrade:
- Look at upgrade notes in the metronic template
- We only use layout 4 so you only need to overwrite those files in:
    - assets/admin/layout4/
    - sass/admin/layout4/
    - templates/admin4/

- Slimscroll is patched to prevent blocking entire page of scrolling after angular state change, more info see PR 198 on their github repo
